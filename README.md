# TODO-List-Application
The Todo List Application is a user-friendly application that is easy to use. Also, colourful background and buttons makes it more appealing to user. The main objective of the project is to allow a user to add, update, delete and search for tasks. The user needs to signup with their email id, password and then use the Todo List Application to enter different tasks scheduled on different dates and time of the day. The Signup feature allows a new user open account in the application and use it. The login window makes it secure thus preventing others to see someoneâ€™s tasks. Reset Password feature allows a user to reset their password and make it stronger. The login details of user and the task details of each user is stored in the database which can be easily fetched for add, update, search and delete operations.
